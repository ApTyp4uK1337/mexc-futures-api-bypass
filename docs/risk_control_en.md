# 🛡️ Risk Control on MEXC

## What Is Risk Control?

**Risk Control (RC)** is an automated system on MEXC that temporarily blocks accounts suspected of suspicious behavior, including manipulative trading or violations of platform rules.

Ban durations:
- **30 days**
- **180 days**
- **365 days**

Support **cannot reduce the duration** — the decision is made by the system.  
Rarely, an **account freeze** may occur: temporary lockout and possible loss of funds.

## ✅ How to Reduce Risk of Ban

### 1. Complete Verification (KYC)
- Use **genuine documents** (your own or close relatives').
- Don’t use fake or purchased identities — you may need to prove ownership later.

### 2. Avoid Account Linking
- Don’t log into multiple accounts from the same IP.
- Don’t use the same wallet for deposits or withdrawals.
- Avoid internal transfers between accounts on MEXC.

### 3. Warm Up Your Account Before Trading
- Start with small manual trades.
- Or use bots that mimic normal user behavior.
- Gradually increase trade size and leverage. Avoid using full balance or high leverage from the start.

### 4. Risk Management
- Keep only disposable funds on the exchange.
- Withdraw profits regularly to external wallets.
- Avoid large or abrupt PnL spikes — they trigger alerts.

## 🧠 Important Notes
